---

import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem, Steps, LinkButton } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Make It MMD helps set up your VRChat avatars for MMD worlds, based on their existing facial expressions.

- üåü It's **non-destructive**. It runs only when you build your avatar, so its original data is never modified.
- ‚úèÔ∏è Settings are **editable any time**. We never bake your settings into your avatar's mesh, so you don't have to start again from scratch.
- ü§ñ Scans and auto-fixes for **common issues**. We take care of Write Default and face mesh renaming for you. Of course, your animator controllers are handled non-destructively.
- üíå Plus **import and export** tools. If you've used a destructive tool before, you can bring in your existing data (only 1:1 blend shape copies supported). And export only shares the expressions chosen, no need to worry about sharing your avatar's mesh data.
