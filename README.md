## Development

### Release management

All development occurs on the `main` branch:

- New releases are cut from the `main` branch as appropriate, so long as it is green.
- There is no `develop` branch.
- Therefore, `main` will have changes that may not be ready for broader release.
- Older releases are supported by cherry-picking to `support/x.x` branches, a practice inspired by GitFlow.

### Setup

On macOS, you will need `vrc-get` which you can install with `brew install vrc-get`.

Then run:

```shell
vrc-get resolve --project .
```

### Code style

This project uses `dotnet format` with `.editorconfig` to enforce style guidelines.

These lints will run automatically when creating pull requests.

You can also run these manually:

```powershell
dotnet format .\enitimeago.non-destructive-mmd.editor.csproj
dotnet format .\enitimeago.non-destructive-mmd.runtime.csproj
dotnet format .\enitimeago.non-destructive-mmd.tests.csproj
```
