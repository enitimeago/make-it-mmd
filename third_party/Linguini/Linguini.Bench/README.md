# Purpose

Some minor benchmarks for Linguini Project. This is not releasable project.

# How to run

In console execute (you can replace `-0` argument with your desired runner number). 
```bash
  cd Linguini.Bench
  dotnet run -p Linguini.Bench.csproj -c Release -0 # Runs first listed project
```

If you enter no arguments, you will get a console prompt asking to select a project.
